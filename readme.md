# Cyberweekly

This is an Eleventy powered website for [Cyberweekly.net](https://cyberweekly.net), a weekly newsletter on cybersecurity, technology and various other matters.

Taken from the rather excellent eleventy-excellent template.

## Credits and Thank yous

> Built around a CSS workflow that emphasizes guiding browser styling rather than micromanaging it. It incorporates progressive enhancement, fluid type and spacing, and utilizes modern CSS features for layout. The goal is to develop frontends that provide a great experience across all devices, connection speeds, and usage contexts.

> Be the browser's mentor, not its micromanager. Give the browser some solid rules and hints, then let it make the right decisions for the people that visit it, based on their device, connection quality and capabilities.

**Steven Woodson**

The style guide was inspired by a [great talk on the Eleventy Meetup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mhA2bH6q8s). Steven also wrote a [blog post](https://stevenwoodson.com/blog/eleventy-style-guide-generator-step-by-step-guide-adding-to-an-existing-site/) about that.

**Aleksandr Hovhannisyan**

Aleksandr seems to value a well-structured project just as much as I do. It was the repo from aleksandrhovhannisyan.com that inspired me to write the article [Organizing the Eleventy config file](https://www.lenesaile.com/en/blog/organizing-the-eleventy-config-file/). The 301 redirect solution I'm using is from Aleksandr's article.

**Manuel MatuzoviÄ‡**

Manuel is an accessibility expert. The menu I was using as default up to v2, is very much inspired by an article Manuel wrote on web.dev.

**Bernard Nijenhuis**

Bernard wrote the article on which the Open Graph Images implementation is based.
