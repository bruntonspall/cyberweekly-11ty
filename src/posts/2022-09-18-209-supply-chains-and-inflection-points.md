We're at a strange time in history for software development and engineering.

Paradigms on how we do software development have changed repeatedly in the last few decades, and most organisations and cultures take far longer than that to change.

That means that it's incredibly difficult to think coherently about what software development looks like, because it can be wildly different in different organisations.

About 10 years ago, I was part of a team [who wrote a new deployment engine for the Guardian newspapers software development team](https://github.com/guardian/riff-raff/graphs/contributors).  We had for a few years been adopting the newest cloud services, and we had realised that our old deployment concept of logging onto the server via SSH and copying the new files onto it was limited.  Our problems were actually related to an entirely orthogonal set of issues, but the solution facing us seemed pretty clear.  We should see our cloud environment as immutable and ephemeral.  That deployment software was designed to ensure that changing code actually spun up new servers with the new code on, and then shutdown the original servers.

In 2012, that was absolutely revolutionary, and almost nobody else in industry was doing it.  In 2022, if you are doing serverless computing, that deployment paradigm has died and gone like the dinosaurs, no longer fit for purpose for a "modern architecture".  But I also work with organisations that are still deploying software onto their mutable everliving server via SSH, SCP or in some memorable cases just using FTP.

Kelly Shortridge wrote an excellent rejoinder to [CISA's guide on securing the software supply chain](https://media.defense.gov/2022/Sep/01/2003068942/-1/-1/0/ESF_SECURING_THE_SOFTWARE_SUPPLY_CHAIN_DEVELOPERS.PDF), and she says this:

> Some recommendations would even be considered “bad practice” by software engineers from a reliability and resilience perspective, and therefore rejected. The guide suggests using “a temporary SSH key” to allow admin access into production systems, whereas Ops engineers and SREs often prefer immutable infrastructure specifically to disallow the use of SSH, which helps with reliability (and cuts off a tempting mechanism for attackers).

I'm totally with her on preferring immutable infrastructure, but this reality has yet to break for a rather shocking number of organisations, and as stated above, in many cases using SSH would be a step up and forward for them!

There's a model of software engineering maturity that can be applied to organisations that can be useful to remember when writing guidance.

At Tier 3, the top tier, software engineering is seen as a core competency for the organisation.  The organisation might see it's software as a critical competitive edge that allows it to outperform other organisations, and it will spend investment in that software development capabilities.  That's where the Googles, the Microsofts and the Ubers of this world are.

At Tier 2, software engineering is seen as big part of the organisation, but not at the top tier.  It's likely subsidiary to profit centers like sales, product and so on.  Software is written, at cost, to meet those aims, and engineering is likely seen as a cost center.  Spending time and money on anything that doesn't deliver new or improved products is likely very hard to argue for.  This is where most companies that have an in house engineering team are

At Tier 1, software engineering is a part of general IT.  The role of the development team, if they even really exist, is purely to automate or improve IT or offer a service that they cannot get elsewhere.  Most development could be outsourced, and the team likely spends its time maintaining custom stuff, and no time at all improving the way that they work.

Of course, especially in Government, in house development may not even be a thing.  Instead one might appoint a "Systems Integrator" a third party company whose only real expertise is to find systems and solutions from elsewhere and glue them together for you.  That means that the Systems Integrator may not do much internal development and it may be in Tier 3 itself, and reliant on its own third parties to do the development.

In this world, your guidance is going to land, to tell you about how to manage your software dependencies, and if you are not a Tier 1 company with hordes of in-house engineers, of course you are going to consider all those developer builds to be a risk, and you are going to want to reduce their ability to make drastic changes to your systems.

I think the original guidance from CISA falls short in all the ways that Kelly highlights, but I also think that suggesting that the solution is to automate all the things is also unreasonable for most of these organisations, who simply won't be able to do the work to create secure and stable supply chains this way.

What we need is something that recognises that there are software development inflection points, places of maturity that an organisation gets to, and then tailor advice to organisations that meets them at the level that they can understand.

Of course, even those [Tier 3 companies can be breached](https://twitter.com/hacks4pancakes/status/1570811890305236992), but more on that next week

> Most enterprises have no chance of implementing the recommendations in “Securing the Software Supply Chain.” It is allegedly meant as a reference guide for developers, but it is really a reference guide for no one other than an intelligence agency with the same goals and resources as the NSA.
> 
> This is a criticism often made about Google: they propose advice that works for them and their titanic budget and pool of talent without considering the constraints and tradeoffs faced by “mere mortals.” CISA, the NSA, and the ODNI have fallen into a similar trap.
> 
> There are numerous recommendations that are impractical for enterprises, and not just the absurd one of disallowing internet access in “development” [4](https://swagitda.com/blog/posts/securing-the-supply-chain-of-nothing/#fn:4) and “engineering” [5](https://swagitda.com/blog/posts/securing-the-supply-chain-of-nothing/#fn:5) systems. For instance, if enterprises documented everything that a piece of software performs, it would be equivalent to writing it twice (and the documentation would inevitably differ from the source code); enterprises would likely be better off with no documentation at all and just reading the source code.
> 
> As another example, they also recommend that “Fuzzing should be performed on all software components during development.” If fuzzing all software components during development was a strict requirement, enterprises might never ship software again [6](https://swagitda.com/blog/posts/securing-the-supply-chain-of-nothing/#fn:6) . They also recommend “Using a testing approach…to ensure that repaired vulnerabilities are truly fixed against **all possible compromises** .” If enterprise software engineering teams knew the graph of possible compromises, why would we need all of this guidance? 


Thanks to several people who sent this my way this week, completely agreeing with Kelly’s take here.  There’s a lot of really good criticisms of this approach in here, that talks about just how complex and difficult a problem this is.

I mostly agree with Kelly’s criticisms, the presented solutions are given as absolutes that in fact trade offs that need to be made, and many enterprises wont want to make these investments.  As I said in the last newsletter, this isn’t given as a set of principles that drive the recommendations, but instead they are just given as rules to follow absent any context.

Secondly, as Kelly points out, much of the advice seems predicated on a rather peculiar software delivery model that is far more common in Government than it is in major enterprises.

An absolutely fascinating new class of attack, and Simon correctly points out just what you can do with it.  Bonus points for discovering a bot in the wild and documenting how people are already attacking it.  Sadly it’s been taken down, but it’s a good example of it being used.

As a reminder, when we first saw SQL injection attacks, the response was to try all kinds of things on user input, but we soon discovered that Injection attacks can be replayed in lots of ways, including reflected attacks, mixed parsing attacks and request smuggling attacks, all of which will likely re-apply here.

> Technology innovations are constant and so any standard that prescribes a mandated configuration is going to be out of date almost immediately. But there is value in industry definitions of, so called, benchmark configurations. The [Center for Internet Security (CIS)](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks/) is a good example of this. It is best to couple principle based regulations with industry-driven standards. For example, a regulatory principle might be to assure you adopt and maintain hardened O/S configurations using recognized industry configuration benchmarks with a risk-driven exception approval mechanism. Then the specific implementation would be, say, to adopt the CIS benchmarks and have an IT Risk Council (or equivalent) review specific exceptions. Showing completeness or some exceptional approval process to a regulator for this principle is more than likely to be satisfactory even if some circumstances dictate non-conformance to the particular benchmarks. The [NIST Cybersecurity Framework](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework) , while not a regulatory standard per se, is a good example of this type of principle, controls, to specific standards approach.
> 
> Measurability is important. When writing regulations, either principle or standards based, it is important to define criteria for assessment, guides for examiners and other approaches for consistency. Some industries in some geographies have gotten quite good at this. The [FFIEC IT Examination Handbooks](https://ithandbook.ffiec.gov/) are a good example. Now, I know some of my former colleagues in financial services might disagree with me, but this approach where there are handbooks written for examiners but made available to the regulated organizations works quite well. It manages to thread the needle between principles and standards with some degree of prescription. Most objectives are clear while giving examiners (and the examined) some latitude for reasonable debate in the context of their institutions. Now, of course, there can be some unreasonable debate depending on the experience of the examiner and the intransigence of those examined. 


Another reminder that writing guidance from the center will almost always struggle to be up to date and applicable.  Instead principles and standards that allow people to maintain their configurations locally

> Yubikeys have multiple authentication methods built in. One of them is a legacy authentication method that makes the yubikey pretend to be a keyboard and type out a complicated long code based on a private key burned into the firmware of the device. This can also be phished. This was the main barrier between any employee and arbitrary user accounts at a past job. You got a corp issued yubikey and you had to use yubikey presses to get into secure areas of the admin panel.

It'd be hilarious if this actually got added to any security training guides. You can disable the OTP interface by following [this guide](https://support.yubico.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013714379-Accidentally-Triggering-OTP-Codes-with-Your-Nano-YubiKey) from Yubico.

> < **Cendyne** > Check out [OTPs Explained](https://developers.yubico.com/OTP/OTPs_Explained.html) from Yubico. A "yubisneeze" has several pieces of info in it, such as a counter to prevent replay. However, it does not contain the time. As a timeless token, it may be scraped and silently submitted elsewhere in the future. The only mitigation would be to immediately verify a newer token with Yubico. Yubikey OTPs are technically interesting but I am not convinced they raise the bar for security proportionate to their proprietary implementation. 


A really useful guide, lots in here that I didn’t know, like for example, that the text string that a Yubikey spits out doesn’t have a timestamp to prevent it being used much much later.

The recommendation further down is to move towards webauthn now, and that PassKeys will replace that _soon._ 


## [APT42: Crooked Charms, Cons and Compromises ](https://www.mandiant.com/media/17826)

[https://www.mandiant.com/media/17826](https://www.mandiant.com/media/17826)

> Mandiant assesses with high confidence that APT42 is an Iranian state-sponsored cyber espionage group tasked with conducting information collection and surveillance operations against individuals and organizations of strategic interest to the Iranian government. We further estimate with moderate confidence that APT42 operates on behalf of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Intelligence Organization (IRGC-IO) based on targeting patterns that align with the organization's operational mandates and priorities.
> 
> Active since at least 2015, APT42 is characterized by highly targeted spear phishing and surveillance operations against individuals and organizations of strategic interest to Iran. The group’s operations, which are designed to build trust and rapport with their victims, have included accessing the personal and corporate email accounts of government officials, former Iranian policymakers or political figures, members of the Iranian diaspora and opposition groups, journalists, and academics who are involved in research on Iran. After gaining access, the group has deployed mobile malware capable of tracking victim locations, recording phone conversations, accessing videos and images, and extracting entire SMS inboxes. 


Given the news of [the Albania hack and the response in expelling Iran’s diplomats](https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/albania-cut-ties-with-iran-over/) , I thought this report by Mandiant (also bought by Google this week) was a good reminder of how this group operates.

> TA505 is a financially motivated threat group that has been active since 2014. The group frequently changes its malware attack strategies in response to global cybercrime trends. It opportunistically adopts new technologies in order to gain leverage over victims before the wider cybersecurity industry catches on.
> 
> This report provides insight into how TA505 enables and manages these attacks through its ”TeslaGun” control panel. The PRODAFT Threat Intelligence (PTI) team identified the group’s control panel and used it to glean insight into how the organization works. 


I thought this was mostly cute because it has screenshots of the malware command and control interface, so you can see what a cybercrime control panel looks like, which is to say bad webdesign and the use of common CSS toolkits mostly. 


## [Can cryptocurrency platforms claim paying attackers is a “White Hat Bounty”? - Red Goat ](https://red-goat.com/can-cryptocurrency-platforms-claim-paying-attackers-is-a-white-hat-bounty/)

> In a move that will likely anger the majority of the cyber security community the term “bug bounty” has been hijacked, or perhaps “redefined” by some cryptocurrency platforms. These platforms have watched millions of dollars’ worth of digital assets vanish right under their noses and have now made a rather surprising move. They have decided to offer their attackers what they are calling a “bug bounty”.
> 
> In essence they are saying “keep some of what you stole and give us back the rest”. Not quite the definition of a bug bounty that I am used to reading about.
> 
> It ultimately seems to be a last-ditch attempt by these platforms to almost beg attackers to return some of the stolen funds. Some of the platforms have offered attackers even as much as $10m. Using the term “bug bounty” is almost certainly a move to make it look more “warm and fluffy” than it ultimately is. Perhaps the one thing more morally questionable than [paying a ransom demand](https://red-goat.com/ransomware-partner/) is freely offering your attacker a cut of their loot! In many ways the use of the term “bug bounty” legitimises the practice but undeniably dilutes the good work actual security researchers do. 


I agree with this analysis.  I don’t think I like using the term bounty for rewarding an activity like this.  The actual capture of assets is stepping well beyond the ethical bounds for conducting proper white hat security research, and is instead for more like extortion than a bounty. 


## [How did the Casio F91W Become a Terrorist Icon? » Reaper Feed ](https://reaperfeed.com/how-did-the-casio-f91w-become-a-terrorist-icon/)

[https://reaperfeed.com/how-did-the-casio-f91w-become-a-terrorist-icon/](https://reaperfeed.com/how-did-the-casio-f91w-become-a-terrorist-icon/)

> During the height of the War on Terror, it didn’t take long for the US government to spot the prevalence of the Casio F91W amongst terrorists. In 2011, Wikileaks released a document labeled the “Matrix of Threat Indicators for Enemy Combatants” which was intended to assist staff at Guantanamo decide which detainees are more likely to carry out suicide attacks. According to the document, owning an F-91W was the biggest giveaway of a serious terror suspect alongside ownership of a satellite phone, a radio transceiver, or large quantities of cash.
> 
> However, this wasn’t just paranoia. Statistics in other similar documents released by Wikileaks revealed that around a third of inmates being held at Guantanamo that were captured whilst wearing an F-91W had a known correlation with explosives. The F-91W watch came up almost 150 times in the piles of leaked [Guantanamo prisoner assessments](https://wikileaks.org/gitmo/pdf/ym/us9ym-000840dp.pdf) . Ironically, four of the chaplains who worked at Guantanimo Bay also wore the watch.
> 
> One of the detainees at Guantanamo was grilled over the prevalence of the watch amongst suspected terrorists. He claimed that the water-resistant feature of the F91W watch was handy due to the Islamic requirement for followers to wash up to their elbows before prayers. Innocent enough explanation, right? Well not really. Interrogators smelled a rat when another prisoner claimed the prevalence of the watch amongst Jihadi inmates was simply due to the built-in compass that helped them pray towards Mecca. However, there is no compass in the F91W.
> 
> Despite the fairly frosty relationship between the two, ISIS didn’t let it get in between their choice of a good wristwatch. The F-91W was a feature of various ISIS militants including Tunisian born Tariq al-Harzi who was a high ranking Emir of the Islamic State. It was also worn by Kevin Chassin who was a French-born Jihadist who went to Syria to join ISIS. He was subsequently utilized for his high propaganda value in ISIS videos. 


The humble and simple Casio watch, the icon of a “digital watch” works precisely because it’s simple, cheap, robust and has just the right set of features to be usable by terror groups.  Of course in the height of the war on terror, there was no smart watches, no fitbits or other competitors, and so I suspect that this could also be an indication of just how popular and mainstream a good product can be.

> [More than 1,000](https://twitter.com/PaulBrandITV/status/1570016117556498432) staff and volunteers will help monitor the line as it snakes across London, with would-be mourners warned they could expect to wait in line longer than 24 hours at its peak. But lines are an amorphous thing as they build, and to try and help people know where to join the back of the queue, the UK’s Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) [has launched](https://twitter.com/PaulBrandITV/status/1570016117556498432) a [livestream on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NpZuGxSgZY&ab_channel=DepartmentforDigital%2CCulture%2CMedia%26Sport) showing how long the line is, and where people should join.
> 
> There’s just one problem: the government used What3Words, a location service built by a London startup that splits up territory into three-by-three meter squares in order to allow more precise geolocation when compared to street addresses.
> 
> What3Words has come under criticism for the way that it refers to locations – using words that can sound similar to one another, while being thousands of miles apart. [Mountain rescuers have said](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-57156797) that staff had been given locations in Russia, Australia and Vietnam to try and help individuals who became stuck in UK mountain ranges.
> 
> Take, for instance, the What3Words location [clown.cars.central](https://what3words.com/clown.cars.central) , near Highland Beach, FL. Get that slightly wrong - say, [clown.card.central](https://what3words.com/clown.card.central) , and you’re suddenly in Bavaria, Germany. The service doesn’t work well with accents, homonyms or frankly, anyone wanting to write anything down from memory.
> 
> Lo and behold, the same issue has befallen the UK government. When the livestream launched at 2:55pm UK time, it directed mourners to the location [same.valve.grid](https://what3words.com/same.valve.grid) – in reality, Bob Belcher Park near Clovis, California. Around 15 minutes later, the stream was updated, directing people to [same.value.grit](https://what3words.com/same.value.grit) , which was closer, in that it was in the London suburbs, but still not right.
> 
> The UK government never got the location right before the end of the line moved, though social media observers believe that both initial errors were transliterations of what should have been the real location, [same.valve.grit.](https://what3words.com/same.valve.grit) By 3:20pm local time, the government scored a success, correctly directing people to [glove.tribal.danger](https://what3words.com/glove.tribal.danger) , narrowly avoiding sending a pinpoint to Michigan or Ohio, which has similar-sounding locations. When the end of line moved again, they weren’t so lucky, sending people to a location 200 miles north of the UK capital in Yorkshire ( [keen.listed.fired](https://what3words.com/keen.listed.fired) : this time, they swapped out an “s” for an “f” in error).
> 
> The next shift also wasn’t right, identifying [shops.views.paths](https://what3words.com/shops.views.paths) in North Carolina as where the queue had stretched to, whereas the real line had ended at [shops.view.paths](https://what3words.com/shops.view.paths) .
> 
> For the next five updates, the queue system and What3Words location worked well – though the line flip-flopped from given.drips.herds to filed.moves.forum and back to given.drips.herds over the course of about an hour. Both are in the vicinity of the palace. 


“The Queue” as it has become known has been quite the impression this week as I’ve walked past it on the way to work every day.  The subject of phishing emails, fraud attempts, but also a pure example of the spirit of britishness that reflects well on the Queen.  The use of What3Words continues for many people who aren’t aware of the issues.  Conceptually very smart, the ability to locate somewhere with 3 simple words, the problem comes from the number of plurals and homonyms.  Sadly, I suspect that the people at DCMS had to build the line locator in a hurry, and using something like this can be done by an intern or junior employee and software you can get off the shelf.

> At least, that was the case until Xu Yanjun’s trial last fall. His arrest marked the first time an MSS officer was [lured out of China and extradited to the US](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-10/accused-chinese-spy-charged-by-u-s-with-economic-espionage) . And it was more than a symbolic victory, yielding an extraordinary trove of digital correspondence, official Chinese intelligence documents, even a personal journal. When Xu was apprehended, he had with him an iPhone whose contents he’d faithfully backed up to the cloud, a lapse that allowed FBI investigators to recover all the data from [Apple Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/AAPL:US) Asked about the case, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded, “The accusations by the US are completely fabricated. We demand the US handle the case in a fair manner and ensure the legitimate rights of Chinese citizens.”
> 
> Over two and a half weeks from late last October into November, federal prosecutors in a courtroom in Cincinnati drew on the wealth of digital material the 41-year-old Xu had stockpiled to lay out a portrait of him—his training, methods, and ambitions, his vices and private doubts and grievances. Translated from the original Mandarin, it’s an unprecedentedly intimate portrait of how China’s economic espionage machine works, and what life is like for its cogs. 


This is a fascinating insight into the influence and “espionage” tactics that MSS officers use when approaching industries of interest.  Bribery, flattery and influence abounds.  Additionally, there’s a real insight into what life is like as an operator in MSS who is conducting this work.
